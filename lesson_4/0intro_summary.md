## Introduction

- be *aware* of SQL optimization:
  - an app that makes fewer queries is faster than a many queried app
  - optimization is complex and beyond the scope of this course
  - the tradeoffs and implementation of indexes
  - comparing different SQL statements
- Know how to use subqueries:
  - know what a subquery is and how to use it (but not know EVERYthing about it)
  - knowing when to use joins and when to use subqueries
  - aren't expected to master subqueries at this point in your studies

## Summary

- What are indexes and Indexes can be used for database optimization?
- How do we compare SQL statements for performance comparisons?
- how do we use subqueries as an alternative to joins and when do we use them?
